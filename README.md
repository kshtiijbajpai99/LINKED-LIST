# ðŸš€ DSA Learning Journey â€“ Linked Lists (9 Aug â€“ 20 Aug 2025)

## ðŸ“… Timeline
**Duration:** 9th August 2025 â€“ 20th August 2025  
**Focus Area:** Mastering Linked Lists in C++

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

### ðŸ§© Core Concepts
- Understanding **Node Structure**  
  - Data field  
  - Pointer(s) to next / previous nodes  
- Memory allocation and pointer management

### ðŸ”— Single Linked List (SLL)
- Insertion:
  - At head
  - At tail
  - At specific position
- Deletion:
  - From head
  - From tail
  - From specific position
- Traversal and printing
- Solved **multiple LeetCode problems** to strengthen logic

### ðŸ”„ Double Linked List (DLL)
- Node creation with `prev` and `next`
- Bidirectional traversal
- Insertion and deletion at:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- Edge case handling for empty lists and single-node lists

### â­• Circular Linked Lists
- **Circular SLL:**
  - Understanding circular connection (last node â†’ head)
  - Insertions and deletions
- **Circular DLL:**
  - Traversing in loops without null termination
  - Pointer adjustments for insertions and deletions

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- Mastered **pointer manipulation** for different linked list types
- Learned the importance of **dry running** before coding
- Practiced **edge case handling** (empty list, single node, invalid position)
- Strengthened problem-solving by applying concepts to **LeetCode problems**
