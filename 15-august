# 📚 DSA Learning Log – Linked Lists

**Date:** 15 August 2025  

## 📝 What I Learned Today
- **Double Linked List (DLL)**  
  - Structure and creation of nodes with `prev` and `next` pointers  
  - Insertion and deletion at head, tail, and specific positions  
  - Traversal in both forward and backward directions  

- **Single Linked List (SLL)**  
  - Solved practice questions  
  - Focused on insertion, deletion, and edge cases  

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- In DLL, we manage **two pointers** (`prev` and `next`) carefully to avoid memory leaks.
- Traversal in DLL is more flexible compared to SLL.
- For SLL, handling the **last node** and **head changes** correctly is critical.
- Drawing diagrams while coding helped avoid pointer mismanagement.
